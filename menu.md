# How to write code productively

1. Always using descriptive name
    ```python
      # This is good
      def aaaaaaaaa():
        return "aaaaaaa"
    ```
1. Always write good document
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together

    :return: sum of two number
    :raise: TypeError when arguments are not number
    """
    return a + b
    ```
1. Implement Junit
2. Accept and improve your code as your team's reviewed.
3. Not edit your test when it looks OK.
